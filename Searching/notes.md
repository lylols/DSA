Searching is a method to find some relevent information in a data set.

LINEAR SEARCH : The algorihtm of linearly searching through an array.

BINARY SEARCH : An algorithm used to search in a sorted array.

-> Divide and conquer algorithm

-> It divides the array into  halves and tries to find the element K in one or the other half, not both. It keeps on doing so until the element is found or the array is exhausted i.e. when s> e it means we have covered the entire array but the element was not present, and we STOP the search at this point.
